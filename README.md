# Turtlebot3-Navigation-with-Hand-Gesture-Control-Obstacle-Avoidance
This project integrates LIDAR-based obstacle avoidance with hand gesture navigation for the TurtleBot3 using ROS2 Noetic. 
The system processes LIDAR data to detect obstacles and determine safe movement directions. 
Simultaneously, it employs MediaPipe to recognize hand gestures via a PC camera, translating them into navigation commands. 
This dual approach enables the TurtleBot3 to navigate autonomously while responding to user gestures.
